## sample news feed written in scala

This is a rudimentary news feed micro-service, written in Scala, with the same features as https://github.com/gengstrand/clojure-news-feed/tree/master/server/feed which is written in Clojure.

This is a micro-service that uses spray so see https://github.com/spray/spray-template as an introduction to that.

This micro-service uses the following technologies; kafka, redis, solr, cassandra, mysql, and postgresql.

See doc/intro.md for a more detailed explanation on how to get everything up and running.

I did this so that I could be able to compare and contrast Scala and Clojure when it comes to writing heterogeneous data source micro-services. See the following blog on what I discovered.
